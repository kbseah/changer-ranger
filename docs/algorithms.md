How do we solve the different change-making problems? The problem is easy to state, but finding a solution is not so straightforward.

The problem is a standard example in algorithms so you can easily find more details in most textbooks.

## Greedy change-making

## Enumerating all ways to make change

## Finding the optimal change faster
