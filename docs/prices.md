title: Real-life prices
---

In the optimal-denomination problem, we assumed that the probability of needing to make change for 1 to 99 cents was uniformly distributed. However, we know that this isn't so, because we encounter prices ending in .99 and .50 more often than, for example, .17. 

Assuming a uniform distribution, Shallit (2003) argued that the US coinage needed an 18-cent piece. What if we used probabilities based on real-life prices?
